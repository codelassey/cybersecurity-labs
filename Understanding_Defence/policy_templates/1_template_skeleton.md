# Information Security Policy Template

> **Purpose:**  
> This template provides a comprehensive, detailed structure for developing any information security policy. It is based on leading frameworks (ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST, CIS) and incorporates best practices from password, access control, BYOD, incident management, vulnerability management, and acceptable use policies.  
> This template serves as a starting from scratch point for drafting, reviewing, or updating any security policy in an organization.

---

## 1. Policy Title

> The official name of the policy (for example "Access Control Policy", "BYOD Security Policy").

---

## 2. Document Control

**Version:**  
> Specify the current version of the policy (for example 1.0). Increment with each approved change.

**Effective Date:**  
> The date on which the policy becomes active and enforceable.

**Next Review Date:**  
> The scheduled date for the next policy review (at least annual, or more frequent if required by law or risk).


---

## 3. Purpose

> **What to include:**  
> - The business, regulatory, compliance, or operational reason for the policy.
> - What the policy is intended to achieve (for example “to ensure only authorized personnel can access sensitive data”).
> - Reference to any standards or frameworks the policy is based on (for example ISO/IEC 27001:2022 which I always like due to using it during the Cyblack bootcamp :) hahaha", NIST, GDPR, and so on).

---

## 4. Terms and Definitions

> **What to include:**  
> - List all technical, legal, or business terms used in the policy that may not be universally understood.
> - Define all acronyms and jargon (for example MFA, SIEM, IRT, BYOD, PAM, RBAC, etc.).
> - Define any key concepts (such as “least privilege”, “incident”, “privileged account”).
> - This ensures clarity, especially for new staff, auditors, and third parties.

---

## 5. Scope

> **What to include:**  
> - Who and what the policy applies to (“All employees, third parties, and all company-owned or managed systems, data, and networks”).
> - Any exceptions or special conditions (for example “This policy does not apply to public-facing web content”).
> - The policy’s coverage (physical, digital, cloud, on-premises, mobile devices).

---

## 6. Roles and Responsibilities

> **What to include:**  
> - List every role with obligations under the policy.
> - For each role, specify their key duties (“CISO: owns the policy, approves exceptions”, “IT Security: implements controls, monitors compliance”, “All users: follow requirements, report incidents”).
> - Include escalation points (who to contact for clarifications, reporting, and exceptions).

---

## 7. Policy Requirements (Policy Statement)

> **What to include:**  
> This is the main body of the policy and must be explicit, prescriptive, and actionable.  
> Organize this section with clear headings and subheadings. **For each requirement:**
> - State what is required, not just what is recommended.
> - Reference standards, legal, or contractual obligations.
> - Use “must” or “shall” for mandatory requirements; “should” or “may” for strong recommendations or options.

### Example Subsections:

#### 7.1 General Security Principles

> State principles like “least privilege”, “need-to-know”, “default deny”, “separation of duties”, and how they are enforced.

#### 7.2 Identification and Authentication

> Specify unique user IDs, password or passphrase requirements, MFA, credential lifecycle (creation, change, revocation), and use of password managers.

#### 7.3 Access Control

> Define RBAC, approval process, working hour restrictions, after-hours access, remote access protocols (VPN, ZTNA), privileged access management, temporary access, and periodic reviews.

#### 7.4 Acceptable Use

> List permitted and prohibited activities on company assets, use of services, handling of sensitive data, and expectations for privacy and monitoring.

#### 7.5 BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)

> Define eligibility, enrollment, device requirements, MDM/UEM controls, data segregation, user and company rights, and the process for onboarding or offboarding devices.

#### 7.6 Vulnerability Management

> Define scanning schedules, risk-based remediation timelines, patching requirements, compensating controls, and reporting.

#### 7.7 Incident Management

> State the incident response model (4-step or 6-step), reporting obligations, IRT activation, containment, eradication, recovery, lessons learned, and regulatory notification.

> **For each requirement:**  
> - Specify controls (technical, procedural, administrative).
> - Clearly define processes (who, what, when, how).
> - Include examples, where helpful (“Passphrases must be at least 15 characters, such as blue-h0rse-nike-shorts@Kantamanto-Ghana”).

---

## 8. Compliance

> **What to include:**  
> - State that compliance is mandatory for all in-scope individuals and systems.
> - Describe how compliance is monitored and enforced (technical controls, audits, reviews).
> - Outline consequences for violations (disciplinary action, revocation of access, reporting to authorities).
> - Reference any supporting procedures or related policies.

---

## 9. Review and Maintenance

> **What to include:**  
> - State the frequency of policy review (at least annually, or after major incidents, regulatory changes, or process updates).
> - Who is responsible for review and updates.
> - Describe how changes are communicated (for example “Updated policies are distributed to all staff and posted on the intranet”).

---

## 10. Related Documents and References

> **What to include:**  
> - List related policies (such as Acceptable Use Policy, Remote Access Policy, Incident Response Plan).
> - Reference relevant standards and laws (ISO/IEC 27001:2022, NIST, GDPR, HIPAA).
> - Include links to procedures, forms, or tools referenced in the policy.

---

## 11. Approval

> **What to include:**  
> - Name and title of the approving authority (for example CISO, Board of Directors).
> - Date of approval.

---

## 12. Revision History

> **What to include:**  
> - Table or list of policy revisions, with version number, date, summary of changes, and author/approver. (So this will be added after revisions are made to the initial policy)

---

## Template Notes

- **Be consistent**: Use clear, unambiguous language and formatting.
- **Be prescriptive**: State requirements, not just recommendations.
- **Be comprehensive**: Address all relevant risks, legal, and business obligations.
- **Reference controls**: Tie requirements to recognized standards or business needs.
- **Keep the policy readable**: Use bullet points, tables, and headings for clarity.

## Fun Fact today haha
When I am writing to github, I usually use :) to express myself to be smiling or laughing but you will realize that in the section outline just above, I was able to bring in an emoji.
Well surprisingly, here's how I did it from my PC and directly in the Github web version. When I pressed :_ in markdown format, I had an option of emojies then I typed in the word smile. I got my emoji!
No big deal but at least could help someone also out 😅
