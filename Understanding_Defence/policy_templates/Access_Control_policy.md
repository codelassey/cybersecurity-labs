## 2.0 Scope

## 3.0 Policy Statements

### 3.1 Access Principles
- **Least Privilege:** Access rights are limited to the minimum required for a user’s job function.
- **Need-to-Know:** Access to sensitive data is restricted to those with a legitimate business need.
- **Default Deny:** Access is denied by default and only granted upon explicit approval.

### 3.2 Access Provisioning and Timing
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access is granted according to documented roles, with annual review of role definitions.
- **Working Hours Limitation:** Access to critical systems and sensitive data is permitted **only during official working hours**.
- **After-Hours Access:**
  - Employees requiring access outside official hours must submit a request in advance to their manager and IT Security, clearly stating the business need and expected timeframe.
  - Approval must be documented and time-bound; after-hours access is revoked automatically once the approved period lapses.
  - **Remote Work:** After-hours remote access must occur strictly through the company’s dedicated VPN with enforced MFA; access from non-corporate networks without VPN is strictly prohibited.
  - **On-Site Work:** After-hours on-site access is allowed only if granted by IT Security; physical access control logs must be reviewed and matched to digital access logs for audit.

### 3.3 Access Management
- **Approval:** All access (including after-hours, remote, and privileged) must be formally requested, justified, and approved by management and IT Security.
- **Temporary Access:** Must be time-limited, documented, and automatically revoked upon expiration.
- **Access Reviews:** Department managers must review user access rights quarterly; privileged access is reviewed monthly.
- **Immediate Revocation:** Access is revoked immediately upon termination, role change, or policy violation.

### 3.4 Privileged Access Management
- All privileged accounts are managed through a Privileged Access Management (PAM) solution.
- Privileged sessions are logged and monitored; just-in-time access is preferred for privileged tasks.

### 3.5 Segregation of Duties
- Duties are segregated to prevent any single individual from controlling critical processes end-to-end.

### 3.6 Third-Party and Vendor Access
- Third-party access is risk-assessed, contractually defined, and time-limited.
- All third-party access is reviewed quarterly and revoked promptly when no longer needed.

### 3.7 Source Code Access
- Source code is accessible only to authorized developers with a documented business need, managed using version control with audit logging.

## 4.0 Monitoring and Enforcement
- Automated controls enforce access windows and log all after-hours access attempts.
- All access activities (including after-hours and VPN sessions) are logged and audited regularly.
- Violations (such as unauthorized after-hours access or bypassing VPN) may result in suspension, disciplinary action, or termination.

## 5.0 Review
This policy is reviewed annually or as required by regulatory or business changes.
