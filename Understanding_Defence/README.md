# Understanding Defense

## What I Learned

### The Need for Network Defense

With the explosive growth of devices (including IoT) and increased mobility, protecting networks is an ongoing challenge. Organizations must defend not only their internal users and resources but also mobile and cloud-based services. Threat actors are constantly searching for vulnerabilities to exploit, making robust network security practices essential.

### Defense-in-Depth

Defense-in-Depth is a layered security approach that protects networks, devices, and data using multiple, redundant safeguards. Key steps include:

- **Asset Identification**: Recognizing all valuable resources (servers, devices, data).
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Identifying weaknesses that could be exploited.
- **Threat Identification**: Determining potential dangers to assets.

Asset management and ongoing assessment are necessary as organizations grow and evolve, making inventory and protection a continuous process.

#### Security Onion & Security Artichoke Analogies

- **Security Onion**: Visualizes defense-in-depth as layers of protection (like onion layers) that a threat actor must peel away to reach valuable assets. Each layer (firewall, IPS, authentication, etc.) increases security.
- **Security Artichoke**: Reflects the modern network's complexity, where not every "leaf" (security measure) must be removed to reach the core. Persistent attackers may exploit individual weaknesses (passwords, databases, client-side attacks) to get to sensitive data.

### Security Policies, Regulations, and Standards

Security policies are essential for governing network activities and ensuring proper behavior. They include:

- **Business (Company) Policies**: Define acceptable behavior and activities for employees, protecting both organizational and worker interests.
- **Employee Policies**: Managed by HR, cover salaries, benefits, schedules, and are reviewed by new employees.
- **Security Policies**: Set objectives and rules for network/system use, specifying requirements for users and administrators. These policies are living documents, adapting to evolving threats and business needs.

### BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) Policies

Allowing employees to use personal devices for work offers benefits (productivity, mobility, cost savings) but introduces risks. A strong BYOD policy should:

- Define program goals and eligible employees/devices.
- Set access levels and security expectations.
- List rights and responsibilities for both employees and the organization.
- Specify safeguards and compliance with regulations.

### Regulatory and Standards Compliance

Organizations must follow external regulations and ethical codes, especially concerning information security. Compliance policies define what organizations must provide and the liabilities for non-compliance, varying by sector and data handled.
