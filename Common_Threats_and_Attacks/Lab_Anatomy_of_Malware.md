# Lab - Anatomy of Malware

## Objectives
---
- Research and analyze malware.

## Background / Scenario
---

Malware, or malicious software, refers to a variety of malicious
software programs that can be used to cause harm to computer systems,
steal data, and bypass security measures. Malware can also attack
critical infrastructure, disable emergency services, cause assembly
lines to make defective products, disable electric generators, and
disrupt transportation services. Security experts estimate that more
than one million new malware threats are released each day. McAfee Labs
Threats Report 2019 indicates the discovery of new ransomware
techniques, the exposing of billions of accounts through high profile
data dumps, significant HTTP web exploitation, defects in Windows,
Microsoft Office, and Apple iOS, and continued attacks on IoT personal
devices.

Conduct a Search of Recent Malware - My Findings 
---

1.  **Interlock Ransomware - Ransomware**

Interlock ransomware is a modern double-extortion malware. Before encrypting files, it steals sensitive data to pressure victims into paying. It uses a PHP-based RAT to scan networks, enumerate backups, and disable recovery options before locking files.

- **How it's transmitted:** Attackers trick users into pasting what looks
like a normal file path into File Explorer. Instead, the string is a
hidden PowerShell command ("FileFix" technique) that launches malware.

- **Impact:** Causes severe operational downtime, data theft, and
financial loss. Healthcare providers, universities, and government
agencies have been among the most affected, with ransom demands reaching
millions.

**2. TeleGrab - Trojan / Info-stealer**

TeleGrab is a Trojan that targets Telegram messaging data. It steals
session files, cache, and contact lists, allowing attackers to hijack
conversations, impersonate users, and access sensitive private data. It
may also be used for cryptocurrency wallet theft.

- **How it's transmitted:** Spread through malicious downloaders and
exploit kits such as SocGholish, often delivered via compromised
websites or fake software updates.

- **Impact:** Victims face stolen identities, hijacked messaging accounts,
financial theft, and exposure of private conversations. For
organizations, it can lead to corporate espionage and reputational
damage.

**3. RomCom's WinRAR Exploit (CVE-2025-8088) - Exploit**

This malware campaign abuses a zero-day vulnerability
in WinRAR (directory traversal bug). Once exploited, it installs remote
backdoors like SnipBot and Mythic Agent, giving attackers long-term
access to systems.

- **How it's transmitted:** Typically delivered via spear-phishing emails
that attach malicious RAR files. When opened in vulnerable versions of
WinRAR, the exploit runs automatically and installs backdoors.

- Impact: Enables attackers to fully compromise systems, allowing
surveillance, remote code execution, lateral movement, and credential
theft. High-value targets include government entities and critical
infrastructure.

**4. SparkCat - Adware / Info-stealer**

SparkCat is a mobile malware family that combines adware with OCR-based
info-stealing. It scans screenshots for sensitive text, such as
cryptocurrency recovery phrases, banking details, or passwords. It also
serves intrusive ads to generate revenue.

- **How it's transmitted:** Distributed via malicious apps uploaded to
third-party app stores and, in some cases, even slipped through into the
official iOS App Store before removal.

- **Impact:** Users may lose cryptocurrency wallets, banking data, or
other sensitive personal information. In addition, infected devices
become overloaded with ads, draining battery life and degrading
performance.
